# unoweb-flutter
This is a little recreation of [unoweb](https://github.com/paytontech/uno-web), a project I made which recreated the core game of UNO! in the web browser. The issue is, however, without a framework, the code got very messy and it got nearly impossible to add anything new. So, here I am, writing this in flutter.


Also I'm trying to write online multiplayer for this game, follow along with [todo-mp.md](https://github.com/paytontech/unoweb_flutter/blob/main/todo-mp.md) to see my journey on that

# Build Instructions
**PLEASE OH PLEASE DO NOT USE BUILD.SH! IT WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR MACHINE. I SIMPLY MADE IT FOR ME SO THAT IT WAS EASIER TO DEPLOY, AND FOR SOME REASON .GITIGNORE DID NOT WORK.**
Instead, this project uses no special build tools. You can download the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and run `flutter build [platform (ipa, apk, macos, windows, linux, web)]` and that should do it for you.
