# unoweb-flutter
This is a little recreation of [unoweb](https://github.com/paytontech/unoweb), a project I made which recreated the core game of UNO! in the web browser. The issue is, however, without a framework, the code got very messy and it got nearly impossible to add anything new. So, here I am, writing this in flutter.

Also I'm trying to write online multiplayer for this game, follow along with [todo-mp.md](https://github.com/paytontech/unoweb_flutter/blob/main/todo-mp.md) to see my journey on that
